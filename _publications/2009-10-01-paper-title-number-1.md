This paper advances literacy field by introducing a novel approach to analyse, structure and classify information from raw log files that sourced from digital reading apps. The key aim of the digital app is to enhance young learnersâ€™ reading skills and provide individualised reccomendations. Our analyses provided an innovative analytical and Cluster Analysis framework to guide researchers in navigating this novel and complex dataset to achieve this aim.
