I am a final-year PhD candidate in **Applied Statistics** at the [Centre for Health Informatics, Computing and Statistics (CHICAS)](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chicas/) at **Lancaster University**. My research bridges **quantitative psychology**, **statistical modeling**, and **educational data science**.

My work focuses on advancing **methodological innovations** in analyzing **large-scale behavioral data**, particularly from **digital reading environments**. I collaborate closely with [Amplify](https://amplify.com/), a U.S.-based educational technology company, where I develop and evaluate data-driven models that inform literacy research and practice.

I bring a strong foundation in **mathematics and statistics**, with particular expertise in:
- **Bayesian modeling** and **latent variable methods**
- **Cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM)**
- **Longitudinal analysis** and **learning analytics**
- Working with **large, complex, and unstructured datasets**

I am also actively engaged in **open science** and reproducible research. My code and papers are available on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Yawen-Ma).

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
