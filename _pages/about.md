I am a final-year PhD candidate in **Applied Statistics** at the [Centre for Health Informatics, Computing and Statistics (CHICAS)](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chicas/) at **Lancaster University**. I am supervised by Dr. [Anastasia Ushakova](https://anastasiaushakova.com), Prof. [Kate Cain](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/about-us/people/kate-cain) and Dr. [Gabriel Wallin](https://gabrieltwallin.github.io).

I'm a self-motivated researcher in **applied statistics** with a strong foundation in **mathematics** and **statistics** applied to a **real-world application** (**education research**). My current focus is on advancing methodological innovations in areas of **quantitative psychology** and **literacy**. Through close collaboration with industrial partner [Amplify](https://amplify.com/) (U.S. based educational technology company), I have developed state of the art expertise in utilisation of **large, complex and unstructured datasets** complemented by strong skills in engagement and knowledge exchange.

I bring a strong foundation in **mathematics and statistics**, with particular expertise in:
- **Longitudinal methods**
- **Cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM)**
- **Item Response Theory Models (IRT)**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Cluster Analysis**
- **Latent Variable Models**
- Working with **large, complex, and unstructured datasets**

I am also actively engaged in **open science** and reproducible research. My code and papers are available on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Yawen-Ma) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=APmyVrQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

You can find my [CV](../assets/CV_YawenMa.pdf) here.
